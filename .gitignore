# TRYING TO DEPRECATE
# Ignore all files AND directories
# *
# but not this file!
# !.gitignore
# Next, Unignore Application and Assets folder and all it's content
# First, application...
# !application/controllers/
# !application/models/
# !application/views/
# And then the assets...
# !assets/
# Updated, add database folder...
# !database/
